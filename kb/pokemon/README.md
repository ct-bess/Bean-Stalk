These files are adapted from [PokeRole's habitat data](https://github.com/XShadeSlayerXx/PokeRole-Discord.py-Base/blob/master/habitats.csv) by @XShadeSlayerXx

### Important things to note

- `stats.json`: object keys need to be lowercase
- Each biome habitat must be represented in the habitats file
- Each habitat *should* have an unique set of pokemon; But duplicates here won't necessarily break the bot
- Each menu must have unique options; No duplicates (ie. don't list the same biome or habitat more than once)
