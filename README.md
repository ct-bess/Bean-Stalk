## Design

Files:

- `src/index.js` is the driver; Contains the event listeners

- `src/commands/` contains command classes
- `kb/` contains data and system admin scripts
- `secrets.json` a very important file

## Build and Run

1. Create the bot from Discord's developer portal & invite to your server

2. Install the node.js version Discord.js is dependent on

   You can find out [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js)
   Installing node.js should also install `npm`

3. Clone the repository and download this project's node module dependencies by running `npm i` in the project's directory

4. Obtain `secrets.json` by incredible means

5. Build the bot with `npm run build` then start him with `npm run start`
